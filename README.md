## Why?

With the **"Zero Configuration"** (e.g. [create-react-app](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)) approach you don't need to care about the underlying technologies and how they are configured. You can just start writing code immediately instead of spending time learning how to setup your build tool.

But, there's a downside here as well. Taking away the power to customize the behavior of your tools means that they might not be useful in all places. Every project is different, and **there can't be a one-size-fits-all solution**.

So, instead of removing all configuration, `web-app-scripts` makes it **smaller** and **less complex**.
